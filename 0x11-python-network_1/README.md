# 0x08. Networking basics #1

## Learning Objectives
- What is localhost/127.0.0.1
- What is 0.0.0.0
- What is /etc/hosts
- How to display your machine’s active network interfaces

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.3-1~ubuntu14.04.1 via apt-get) without any errors
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing


- For the sake of the exercise, this connection is made entirely within localhost. This isn’t really exciting as is, but we can use this script across networks as well. Try running it between your local PC and your remote server for fun!
